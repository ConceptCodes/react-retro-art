# Retro Art - React.js + Tailwindcss
This is a single page web application built in [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and powered by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) & [Tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com). The concept for the UI came from a post I saw on pinterest by [Oww Studio](https://dribbble.com/shots/15865317-RetroArt-NFT-Markerplace-Header-Exploration). The retro theme looked very appealing and who doesn't love NFT's. For Hosting im using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for simplicity.
